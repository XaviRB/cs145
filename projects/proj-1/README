Finish implementing the program Closest.  It should read a table of points from
System.in and print the distance between the two points that are the closest
together.  The complicating factor here is that the points are in an arbitrary
number of dimensions.

Here are the rules:

  You must implement at least one additional function.

  You must document the code.  Note that some of the functions have already been
     documented, but other have not.  Any functions you add must be documented.
     The comments should explain the code.  Do not explain the language.  

  Your code must be easy to understand.  This means good function and variable
     names.  You cannot use non-switch break statements, continue statements, or
     arbitrary returns.

  It must compile without errors or warnings.


There are five sample files.  
  
  $ cat sample1 | java Closest 
  0.5

  $ cat sample2 | java Closest
  0.10152899417451168

  $ cat sample3 | java Closest
  4.4320605273595604E-4

  $ cat sample4 | java Closest
  0.0010413730277685218

  $ cat sample5 | java Closest
  0.023098119349816305

Please note that your output does not have to be exactly the same.  There may be
slight differences in the values.  These differences should be many places past
the decimal point.
